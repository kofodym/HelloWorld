        <p>
          <b>CSS, short for <em>Cascading Style Sheets</em></b>, is a fundamental web
          technology used to style and format the visual appearance of web
          pages.
        </p>

        <p>
          CSS operates on a selector-based system, where selectors target
          specific HTML elements or groups of elements to apply styling rules.
        </p>

        <ul class="highlight">
          <p>These rules include properties such as:</p>
          <li>color</li>
          <li>font-size</li>
          <li>margin</li>
          <li>padding and more.</li>
